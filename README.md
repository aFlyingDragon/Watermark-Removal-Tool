# Watermark-Removal-Tool
**OS:** Windows 10 <br>
**Python Version:** 3.10.0
## Tool Info:
This tool requires some trial and error and is a working work in progress. It brings up a pixel evaluator after image selection that allows the user to determine which RGB values correspond to the undesired pixels and removes all occurrences of those pixels. Need to redefine the evaluation criteria on each use.
